# 💻 Programming Languages – Core Notes

This repository contains **concise notes and basic examples** of widely used programming languages.  
It is designed for **students, beginners, interview preparation, and quick revision**.

The purpose of this repository is to understand:
- Basics of programming languages  
- Key features  
- Use cases  
- Differences between popular languages  

---

## 📌 Languages Covered

- C  
- C++  
- Java  
- Python  
- JavaScript  

---

## ⚙️ C Language

**Type:** Procedural, Low-level, Compiled  
**Used for:** Operating systems, Embedded systems, System programming  

### 🔑 Key Features
- Fast execution  
- Direct memory access  
- Simple and powerful  

### 📌 Example
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
```
---
## 🧠 C++ Language

**Type:** Object-Oriented & Procedural, Compiled  
**Used for:** Game development, System software, High-performance applications  

### 🔑 Key Features
- Supports Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism)  
- Very fast execution speed  
- Rich Standard Template Library (STL)  
- Supports both low-level and high-level programming  

### 📌 Example
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!";
    return 0;
}
```

## ☕ Java Language

**Type:** Object-Oriented, Compiled (JVM-based)  
**Used for:** Enterprise applications, Android development, Web applications  

### 🔑 Key Features
- Platform independent (Write Once, Run Anywhere)  
- Automatic memory management (Garbage Collection)  
- Strong security features  
- Robust and scalable  

### 📌 Example
```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## 🐍 Python Language

**Type:** High-level, Interpreted  
**Used for:** Data Science, AI/ML, Automation, Web development  

### 🔑 Key Features
- Simple and easy-to-read syntax  
- Large standard library and third-party modules  
- Dynamically typed language  
- Supports multiple programming paradigms (Procedural, OOP, Functional)  

### 📌 Example
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
